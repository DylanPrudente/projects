This "projects" repository contains code for an educational website. I developed this website with the help of AI to complete my final project for Engineering Psychology at Tufts University. 

The website utilizes a home page from which the user can navigate to any specific psychology demo. The general code for style and the home page are in the main folder, while all of the demo-specific code can be found in the demos folder.
