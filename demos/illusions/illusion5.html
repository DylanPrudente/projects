    <p>
        The Ebbinghaus illusion involves two circles of the same size, each surrounded by different-sized circles. The central circle surrounded by smaller circles appears larger than the one surrounded by larger circles. This illusion highlights the influence of relative size and contextual comparison in visual perception. It shows how our brain doesn’t evaluate objects in isolation but instead in relation to nearby objects. This has implications for everything from design to user interface layouts, where visual proximity can alter how elements are perceived.    </p>
