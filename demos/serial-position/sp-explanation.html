    <h2>Explanation:</h2>
    <p>
      The serial position effect is a cognitive phenomenon that describes how the position of an item in a list influences how well it is remembered. Specifically, people tend to recall the first items (the <strong>primacy effect</strong>) and the last items (the <strong>recency effect</strong>) more effectively than those in the middle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The primacy effect occurs because early items are more likely to be transferred into long-term memory through rehearsal. In contrast, the recency effect happens because the last items are still in working memory at the time of recall. Items in the middle are often less well remembered because they neither benefit from early rehearsal nor remain in working memory. This effect highlights the interplay between short-term and long-term memory systems.
