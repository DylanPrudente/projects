    // Explanation of DRM effect
    const explanation = `
      This demonstration illustrates the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm, a well-known phenomenon in cognitive psychology. When people are shown a list of words that are all closely related in meaning—such as "bed," "rest," "tired," and "dream"—many will falsely recall or recognize a related word like "sleep," even though it was never presented. 

This occurs because our brains tend to organize and store information semantically, forming associative networks. The false memory arises when the non-presented word is strongly activated by the surrounding words. This effect highlights how memory is not a perfect recording device but a reconstructive process, influenced by meaning, context, and prior knowledge.
