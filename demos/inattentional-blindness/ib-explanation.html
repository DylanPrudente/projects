    <h1>Inattentional Blindness Explanation</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Explanation:</strong> 
    </p>
    <p>
      Inattentional blindness is a psychological phenomenon in which individuals fail to perceive an unexpected stimulus that is in plain sight, because their attention is engaged on a different task. This illustrates the limits of our attentional capacity and the fact that perception is not simply a matter of seeing, but also of where we direct our cognitive resources.

      In the famous experiment shown in the video, participants are asked to count how many times a basketball is passed between players. While their attention is narrowly focused on this task, many completely miss the unexpected appearance of a person in a gorilla suit walking through the scene. This classic example demonstrates how selective attention can cause us to overlook even highly salient events when they fall outside our attentional spotlight.
